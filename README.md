# Remote User Store Connect Samples

This repository contains two sample applications to connect a locally running remote user store to a third party service and perform user store operations. For example, these applications can be used with WSO2 Identity Server or Asgardeo to connect a remote user store.

1. [Simple GRPC User Store](/simple-grpc-user-store/)
2. [Bi-Directional User Store](/bi-di-user-store/)
